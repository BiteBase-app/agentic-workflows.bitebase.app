# Wrangler Deployment Fix

## Issue

Cloudflare Workers deployment was failing with the error:

```
âœ˜ [ERROR] The expected output file at "dist/index.js" was not found after running custom build: npm run build.
```

The problem was a mismatch between the build output location (`dist/src/index.js`) and where Wrangler expected to find it (`dist/index.js`).

## Solution

We implemented a multi-part solution:

1. **Created a build preparation script**:
   - Added `scripts/prepare-wrangler.js` that copies the compiled files to the location Wrangler expects
   - The script copies `dist/src/index.js` to `dist/index.js` along with source maps and type definitions

2. **Updated build process**:
   - Modified the `postbuild` script in package.json to run the preparation script automatically
   - Ensured the script runs after the TypeScript compilation and undici-types restoration

3. **Fixed Wrangler configuration**:
   - Updated `wrangler.toml` to set `main = "dist/index.js"` which matches the new file location
   - Removed deprecated configuration entries as suggested by Wrangler warnings
   - Commented out `zone_id` which is unnecessary per Wrangler's recommendation
   - Removed `[build.upload].format` setting which is now inferred automatically

## Additional Improvements

1. **Updated deployment scripts** for cross-platform compatibility

2. **Removed unnecessary configuration** to reduce warnings and simplify deployment

3. **Created comprehensive documentation** including:
   - Deployment guide with best practices
   - Troubleshooting tips for common issues
   - Documentation for configuration files and their settings

## Benefits

1. **More reliable deployment** process that works regardless of TypeScript output path
2. **Reduced warning messages** from Wrangler
3. **Simplified configuration** that's easier to maintain
4. **Improved build automation** with clear preparation steps

These changes make the build and deployment process more robust and less prone to path-related issues, while also addressing Wrangler's warnings about deprecated configuration options.
